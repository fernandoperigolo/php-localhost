PHP Localhost
=============

This is a experimental project to make yout localhost php page(the subfolders tree) more easy to use and spend my time.

Why this is better then the just subfolder tree:

- The itens of subfolders list have now more spacing each other, makes more easy to click in the right folder, even in mobile devices;
- Included a little URL manager to support our projects that have custom path at vhosts.
